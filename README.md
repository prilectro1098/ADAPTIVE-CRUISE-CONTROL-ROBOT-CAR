# ADAPTIVE-CRUISE-CONTROL-ROBOT-CAR
I had the opportunity to work on an Adaptive Cruise Control Car using an L298N H-bridge, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, DC motors, and an I2C LCD display. This project allows the car to adjust its speed automatically, based on distance detection, ensuring a safe and efficient driving experience. üõ†Ô∏è
